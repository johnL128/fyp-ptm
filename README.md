# Final Year Project
**Project: Predictive Strategy Modelling Using ML Integrated Simulation**

## Key Functionality
- Simulate strategies using ML data
- Incorporates probabilistic influences i.e. Safety Car/Red Flags
- Utilises limited data to predict tyre deltas of circuits

## Challenges
- Limited tyre data publically available so the sue of FastF1, Openf1 was used
